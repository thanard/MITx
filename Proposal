My UROP project for this summer is "6.MITx" for CSAIL (Computer Science and Artificial Intelligent Lab) in the Electrical Engineering/Computer Science Department. MITx is an on-line teaching and learning tool that will have potential to improve education both on MIT itself and around the world. The project will be to learn and use technologies enabling on-line education such as MITx in order to create on-line hands-on activities. These technologies will be used to prototype on-line activities for MITx courses. 

Our group will be working in 34-501 and some extra time at home. Work plan is 11 weeks, from 6/10 through 8/23. There will be a two-week hands-on bootcamp at the beginning on Javascript and other tools for creating browser-based interactions. Then work in small teams on particular interaction projects (eg, visualizations and interactions for EECS courses). The hope is that each person will complete two to three projects in July and August. 

I will have main three roles: (1) learning about Javascript and the browser environment, (2) designing and implementing prototype on-line activities for MITx, and (3) participating in user studies and giving feedback on other 6.MITx projects.

This project appeals to me because I believe that it will break down the barrier to education for underprivileged people. It will provide more accessibility to knowledge for those people. My goal is to finish building sophisticated browser-based interactions for use in on-line courses that million of people can use. Personally, I will gain a lot of knowledge in web programming and programing skill in Javascript, DOM, and HTML5 canvas. Since programming requires team-work, I will also have more friends and learn to work with them. I am certain that the project will be very beneficial not only to me, but also to other people around the world.
